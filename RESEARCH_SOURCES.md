## Market Intelligence

### Enterprise AI Priorities (2026)
1. **Cost Control** - AI infrastructure costs are exploding (up 30% MoM for many enterprises)
2. **Data Privacy** - Regulatory pressure (GDPR fines €35M+, HIPAA compliance)
3. **Latency Requirements** - Real-time inference critical for customer-facing apps
4. **Vendor Lock-in Reduction** - Multi-cloud, on-premise options needed
5. **Edge Computing** - 5G adoption, IoT explosion, offline-first requirements

### Why This Matters for SLMs
- Addresses all 5 enterprise priorities simultaneously
- LLMs only solve cost marginally
- Traditional AI can't match edge performance
